' RC BUGS
' =======

' about widget image shadows not rendering correctly in the stopwatch, same code on RC5 widget works correctly

' aboutForm is not fading back-in but instantly hiding in DPI aware mode, opacity is acting strangely on second fade in

' tooltips also resize when the whole thing is resized, which is not necessarily a good idea for a UI.

' Opacity, cannot set the opacity for surfaces
'     Cairo.ImageList.AddSurface
'     Set Pat = Cairo.ImageList(Key).CreateSurfacePattern
'  For widgets, I can set the alpha but not for surfaces, I assume I have to
'  perform some intermediate step to make a surface transparent.  Is there no CC.Paint_with_Alpha?
'  I could extract the excluded layers to PNGs and then use RenderSurfaceContent that has an alpha value

' W.MousePointer = IDC_SIZEALL
' overlayWidget.Widget.MousePointer = IDC_SIZEALL
'
' these have no effect
